## Future Roadmap

In future versions of this project, I plan to add the option to customize the game pieces. Instead of just 'X' and 'O', players will be able to choose from different characters whose images will be displayed on the board cells. This addition will allow players to give a unique and personalized touch to their gaming experience.
